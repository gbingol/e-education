This is a Telnet-based courseware system I had purely developed using Java in 2000 
for Heat Transfer and Thermodynamics in Istanbul Technical University Food Engineering Department. 



Briefly, using a Telnet client, students connected to a server, which was running in our labs (Prof Dr Y Onur Devres group).
For each question the text was the same whereas numerical values were unique for each student requiring unique answers.
This promoted true collaboration between students and required each student to solve his/her own question.



As evidenced in publications (pdf docs) in 2001 I gradually transferred the Telnet-based system 
to a more user-friendly Java Server Pages based technology.
