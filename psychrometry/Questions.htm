<h2>HEATING WITH HUMIDIFICATION - Psik 02</h2>
    
<p>
    An air conditioning system is to take in outdoor air at T<sub>1</sub>&deg;C and %RH<sub>1</sub> 
    relative humidity at a steady rate of V<sub>1</sub> (m<sup>3</sup>/min) and to condition 
    it to T<sub>3</sub>&deg;C %RH<sub>3</sub> relative humidity. The outdoor air is first 
    heated to T<sub>2</sub>&deg;C in the heating section and then humidified by the injection of 
    hot steam in the humidifying section.
    
    Assuming the entire process takes place at a pressure of P(kPa), determine,</p>

    <p>a) the rate of heat supply in the heating section (kJ/min)</p>
    <p>b) the mass flow rate of the steam required in the humidifying section.</p>

<h2>COOLING WITH DEHUMIDIFICATION - Psik 03</h2>

<p>Air enters a window air conditioner at P(atm),T<sub>1</sub>&deg;C, %RH<sub>1</sub> relative humidity 
    at a rate of V<sub>1</sub>(m<sup>3</sup>/min),
    and it leaves T<sub>3</sub>&deg;C, %RH<sub>3</sub> relative humidity. Part of the moisture in
    the air which condenses during the process is also removed at T<sub>2</sub>&deg;C. Determine,</p>
    <p>a) the rates of heat removal from the air,</p>
    <p>b) the rates of moisture removal from the air.</p>

<h2>EVAPORATIVE COOLING -  Psik 04</h2>

<p>
    Air enters an evaporative cooler at P (kPa), T<sub>enterance</sub>&deg;C and %RH<sub>enterance</sub> relative humidity, 
    and it exits at RHexit percent relative humitidiy.  Determine </p>

   <p> a) The exit temperature of the air</p>

    <p>b) The lowest temperature to which the air can be cooled by this evaporative cooler.    </p>               

   <p> HINT : Assume that wet-bulb temperature and enthalpy are constant.</p>

</p>

<h2>ADIABATIC MIXING OF AIRSTREAMS - Psik 05</h2>

<p>
    Saturated air leaving the cooling section of an air conditioning system at T1&deg;C at a rate of 
    V<sub>1</sub> (m3/min) is mixed adiabatically with outside air at T2&deg;C and RH2 percent relative humidity at a 
    rate of V2 (m3/min).  Assuming that the mixing process occurs at a pressure of P(atm), 
    determine the specific humidity, the relative humidity, the dry-bulb temperature, 
    and the volume flow rate of the mixture.
</p>

<h2>WET COOLING TOWERS - Psik 06</h2>
<p>
    Cooling water leaves the condenser of a power plant and enters a wet cooling tower at 
    Tenterance&deg;C at a rate of V (kg/s).  The water is cooled to Tcooling&deg;C in the cooling tower 
    by air which enters the tower at P (atm), Tair&deg;C, RHair percent and leaves saturated at Texit air&deg;C.  
    Neglecting the power input to the fan, determine,
</p>

<p>the volume flow rate of air into the cooling tower and</p>
<p>the mass flow rate of the required makeup water.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>MIXTURE OF AIRSTREAMS - Psik 07</h2>
<p>
    It is common practice in many air-conditioning systems to mix a small amount of fresh outside air with 
    the cool air coming off the refrigerant coils.  In  a Texas application the air from the cooling coils 
    is at Tair&deg;C and Xair percent humidity, and it is to be mixed with Y percent outside air at Toutside air&deg;C and 
    Xoutside air percent humidity.  Calculate the final temperature and relative humidity of the mixture.
</p>

<h2>COOLING TOWER FOR A POWER PLANT - Psik 08</h2>
<p>
    A power plant requires that R<sub>water</sub> (kg/s) of water to be cooled from Tinitial to Tfinal&deg;C.  
    Inlet air for a cooling tower is available at T<sub>inlet air</sub>&deg;C and RHinlet air percent relative humidity 
    and may be assumed to leave the tower at T<sub>leaving air</sub>&deg;C and RHleaving air percent relative humidity.  
    Make-up water is available at Tmake-up&deg;C.  Calculate the mass flow rates of air and make-up water required.
</p>

<h2>AIR CONDITIONING - Psik 09</h2>

<p>
    Air is required to be delivered to a room at a dry bulb temperature of Tdb&deg;C and with a relative humidity of RH%.   
    The calculation is to be used based on an air flow of Rair flow rate (m3/s) into the room, and it can be assumed 
    that the corresponding fan input is P<sub>fan</sub> (kW).  Calculate the condition at which the air must leave the heater.  
    Assume that the pressure throughout the plant is constant at Ppressure of air (kPa).
</p>

<h2>FAN INDUCED COOLING TOWER - Psik 10</h2>

<p>
    A small-size cooling tower is designed to cool L (lt/s) of water per second, the inlet temperature of which is T<sub>water inlet</sub>&deg;C.  
    The motor-driven fan induces R<sub>air</sub> (m<sup>3</sup>/s) of air through the tower and the power absorbed is P<sub>fan</sub> (kW).  
    The air entering the tower is at T<sub>entering</sub> air&deg;C, and has a relative humidity of RH<sub>entering air</sub>%.  
    The air leaving the tower can be assumed to be saturated and its temperature is T<sub>leaving</sub> air&deg;C.  
    Calculate the final temperature of water and the amount of cooling water make-up required per second.  
    Assume that the pressure remains constant throughout the tower at P (kPa).
</p>

<h2>ADIABATIC SATURATION PROCESS - Psik 11</h2>

<p>
    In an adiabatic saturation process, dry air + water vapor enters a long insulated channel at P (kPa) and T&deg;C and 
    leaves at T<sub>saturation</sub>&deg;C, which also is the saturation temperature.  Determine the absolute and relative humidity of 
    mixture at the enterance of channel.

<p>
    Dry-air and water vapour mixture enters a heater-humidifier at T<sub>inlet</sub>&deg;C, Pinlet (kPa) and RHinlet% relative humidity 
    and exits at T<sub>exit</sub>&deg;C and P<sub>exit</sub> (kPa).  Rate of the dry-air is R<sub>dry</sub> air (kg/s).  For humidification process water 
    at T<sub>water</sub>&deg;C is sprayed into the mixture with rate of Rwater sprayed (kg/s).   Determine,
</p>

<p>b) The heat transfer to the heater</p>
