APPLET:

I developed the applet in 1999 as part of my bachelor project.
Initially I developed it using Visual Basic 6.0 and then translated to Java. 
Therefore some similarities to VB 6.0 exists in coding style.

Please see the pdf files for details on calculation procedures.


NOTE: Please note that this code has not been updated or maintained since 2000. 




VB Binary:

The last time it was updated was in 2006. It contains:
1) Calculation of Psychrometric properties of humid air
2) Calculation of thermodynamic properties of refrigerants.
3) Some tutorial questions.

It works on Windows 10.
